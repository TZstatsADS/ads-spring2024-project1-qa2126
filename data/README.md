# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
All data here are from the happiness project. Only cleaned_hm.csv and demographic.csv are used for this project, but family-dict.csv was inspected as well.
